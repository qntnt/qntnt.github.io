### How your data are processed

Pollbot only stores user data submitted through correctly formatted pollbot commands and direct messages. Pollbot stores poll topics, poll options, guild ids, channel ids, and user ids of those who interact with polls. Pollbot only stores data that is necessary to function and nothing else.

If you'd like to delete your user data, there is a command "!pollbot deleteMyUserData" that will delete all of your stored poll data, ballot data, and references to your user id. For further questions, please reach out to the support server.

### Third Parties

Pollbot uses Google Firebase's Cloud Firestore as a third-party vendor to manage and access persistent data. Firestore encrypts data at rest.
Discord manages all message data and privileges, sending data to Pollbot with valid permission configurations.

I created this game in 3 days for Zeno Game Jam 5.

> Edsger is having a bad week. He's in between jobs. His savings are running. He just swatted a magic bug and is stranded in an unfamiliar world.
> Use game-breaking bugs and glitches to get Edsger back home.

This game is hard. But it is achievable.
